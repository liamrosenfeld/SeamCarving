 # Finding Seams
 
 Seams will be what we call the path of pixels that we remove from the image to reduce its width.
 
 Our criteria for the seam is as follows:
 - The path that crosses the least edges (as determined by the Sobel filter)
 - The path can lead to the three pixels under the current pixel (directly under and both diagonally adjacent)
 
 Those three candidates are shown on this diagram:
 
 ![Candidate Diagram](/CandidateDiagram.jpg)
 
 ## Possible Algoritms
 
 One attempt at finding the seam may be using a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is one that always picks the immediately most optimal option. In this case, it would always pick the lowest of the three three candidates available for each row of the image.
 
 While that may be optimized for performance, it has issues consistently finding the best path.
 
 The seam has a maximum horizontal speed of one column per row, so taking a strictly greedy algorithm could easily get the seam stuck only having candidates with high edginess (value of pixel from the Sobel Filter output) of the later in the image.
 
 The pitfall of not knowing if the path is the most optimal path possible can be removed by using an algorithm that checks for all possible paths through an image.
 
 It would then choose the path where the sum of all the edginess values is the least. While that would always give us the best possible path through an image, it is also extremely slow.
 
 The time complexity of that method would be on the order of `cols * 3^rows`, so it would not be of practical use on any reasonably sized image.
 
 ## Optimizing Through Dynamic Programming
 
 Dynamic programming is a technique for optimizing algorithms by breaking them into subparts that are able to be shared by other subparts. That can greatly reduce the need for redundant work.
 
 The fundamental fact that will allow us to optimize is that at each pixel, there is a path of minimum total edginess to the bottom of the image. Since that will always be the optimal path from that pixel, any seam that includes that pixel will follow that path for the rest of the image.
 
 That allows us to assign each pixel a value of the total edginess of the most optimal path to the bottom. Using that value for calculating the value of pixels above greatly decreases the amount of redundant work neededâ€”a major dynamic programming win.
 
 To find the value for each pixel, the matrix of sums can be built from the bottom up. Since the total sum at each candidate would be known, all that would be necessary for finding the sum at each pixel is to add the minimum sum of the candidates and the value of itself.

 That greatly optimizes the algorithm by removing the redundant work, bringing the time complexity down to the much more reasonable `3 * rows * cols`.
 
 # Implementation
 
 We first need a min function that is able to find the minimum value and the index of that value. While an enumerated array would make sense for finding the minimum amount of a larger collection of values, a flattened version is more performance friendly at this scale.
 
 This function also differs from most min finding functions because it prefers the middle value over the sides if they are equal.
 
 This is preferable because they are equal when there is no left or right pixel (min and max are used to prevent overflows inline in our summing function) along with general preference for the seam to travel straight down if the options happen to be equivalent (leads to a generally less noticeable removal).
 
 This min function with our specific criteria can be implemented as below:
 */

func minWithIndex(_ val0: UInt32, _ val1: UInt32, _ val2: UInt32) -> (val: UInt32, index: Int8) {
    // prefer center index
    var index: Int8 = 1
    var min = val1
    
    // check left
    if val0 < min {
        index = 0
        min = val0
    }
    
    // check right
    if val2 < min {
        index = 2
        min = val2
    }
    
    return (min, index)
}

/*:
 Now we can use that function inside of our edginess summing function.
 
 Our function will take the result of our Sobel filter as an 8-bit planar accelerate buffer.
 
 It will return the sum and the direction (to the candidate chosen) at each pixel as two separate matrixes.
 They will both be needed to calculate our seam.
 
 How each part of the function works is explained in the inline comments.

 The triangular pattern that appears above edges in the sums is significant because it marks out places, that if the path ever touched, there would be no way to dodge the edge. That reflects the maximum rate the path can travel horizontally.
