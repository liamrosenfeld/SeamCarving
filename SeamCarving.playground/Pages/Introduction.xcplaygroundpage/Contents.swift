 # Image Seam Carving
 
 Hello! I'm Liam Rosenfeld. I'm a 12th grader from Florida and this is my WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge submission.
 
 Over the past two years, I had a great time exploring signal processing through my two successful scholarship applications. Last year, that exploration introduced me to Accelerate and I immediately went down that rabbit hole. I started learning about vImage, and updated my app, Image to ASCII Art, to utilize it (resulting in a noticeable speed up). As I learned more about images, I came across the seam carving algorithm online and instantly was drawn to it because of how it utilizes math to a way that feels magical.
 
 Seam carving is a method of content aware resizing images. That means it is able to change the aspect ratio of an image without resulting in visually unpleasant squashing. It is able to 
 
 by intelligently removing pixels from inside the image that it determines are not necessary. This algorithm includes many steps, and these will be a page of this playground dedicated to each with a detailed explanation of the code.
 
 Now without further ado, let's dig into this together.
 
 Note:
 - Some pages may take a couple seconds to run because there are some computation heavy operations
 - Due to the highly iterative nature of some code, the playground results sidebar would slow it down dramatically. For that reason some code is commented out and called instead as a function stored elsewhere.
